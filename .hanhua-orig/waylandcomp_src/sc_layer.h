/*
 * Layer mode (BANNER_WAYLAND_ZERO_COPY=1): the scene is handed to SurfaceFlinger as a small,
 * deliberately ordered SET of Android display layers - ASurfaceControl children of the
 * compositor's SurfaceView - instead of being blitted into the compositor's own swapchain.
 *
 *     app window ......... Compose UI, the in-game drawer, the HUD, the on-screen controls and
 *                          the pointer arrow: ordinary Android views, ALWAYS above everything
 *                          below (the SurfaceView is not Z-on-top, so its whole subtree is under
 *                          the window's own content). None of the layers below take input:
 *                          an ASurfaceControl has no input channel, so touch and mouse keep
 *                          reaching the SurfaceView exactly as they did.
 *     +-- SurfaceView ..... the compositor's Vulkan swapchain; black while layer mode is up
 *          +-- z=1 "banner_wayland_game" ...... the one fullscreen game window
 *          +-- z=2 "banner_wayland_overlay" ... at most one window drawn ABOVE the game
 *
 * TWO layers is the hard cap (SC_LAYER_COUNT), and deliberately so: HWC composes only a few
 * layers before SurfaceFlinger falls back to GPU client composition, which would throw away the
 * whole benefit. The count is logged when the second layer first goes up.
 *
 * MEASURED on the Pocket FIT (Adreno 750, portrait panel + landscape session, so every layer is
 * ROT_90 + scaled), `dumpsys android.hardware.graphics.composer3.IComposer/default`: one layer is
 * `composition: DEVICE/DEVICE`, effects on the layer keep it DEVICE/DEVICE - but a SECOND layer
 * flips the whole frame to `DEVICE/CLIENT`. It does not come back when the overlay goes away.
 * The overlay layer is retired rather than hidden for that reason, but the fallback outlives it.
 * The likely mechanism is the DPU's rotator budget (one rotated+scaled layer), not the layer count
 * as such, so a device or orientation needing no rotation may well take both on the DPU. Even in
 * client composition the overlay layer is not a loss - SurfaceFlinger does the one blit the
 * compositor would have done - but the hardware-composition win is only real for one layer.
 *
 * COMPOSITION RECOVERY (sc_layer.c, swap_sc_begin): retiring the overlay arms the game layer, and
 * the NEXT frame is presented on a brand-new SurfaceControl while the old one is hidden and
 * unparented in the SAME transaction. SurfaceFlinger applies a transaction atomically, so no
 * composited frame is ever missing the game - no black frame, no dropped frame beyond the layer
 * creation itself. One `layer` line is written when it happens.
 *
 *  It does NOT restore hardware composition on this panel, and that was measured, not assumed
 * (2026-09-14, Wizardry on the game layer + Wine's Task Manager on the overlay, reproduced twice):
 *   - two layers                                  -> DEVICE/CLIENT
 *   - overlay retired + fresh game SurfaceControl -> still DEVICE/CLIENT, 24 s later too
 *   - layer path dropped entirely and re-created  -> still DEVICE/CLIENT
 *   - drawer opened and closed, no second window  -> DEVICE/DEVICE (control: the drawer is not the cause)
 *   - HOME + resume                               -> DEVICE/DEVICE
 * HOME + resume re-creates the app's whole window and SurfaceView (`VRI[XServerDisplayActivity]#0`
 * becomes `#4`), not just this child layer - so the sticky state belongs to the parent surface or
 * the display. Re-creating the parent would cost a real black frame and a swapchain rebuild, which
 * is worse than the few percent of GPU that client composition costs. The cure that actually keeps
 * the win is PREVENTION, and it IS implemented: sc_layer_overlay_affordable() declines the second
 * layer when the game layer is both rotated and scaled, and the window above the game goes down the
 * copy path instead (what the pre-phase-4 code did) - one blit SurfaceFlinger would have done
 * anyway, and the session keeps DEVICE composition throughout. Where a second layer costs nothing,
 * nothing changes.
 *
 * What can be on the game layer, cheapest first:
 *   - the game's own gralloc buffer (ahb_swapchain.c, true zero-copy: no copy anywhere);
 *   - one blit of the game's frame into a compositor-allocated AHardwareBuffer (sc_layer_present);
 *   - with screen effects on, the compositor pass's result blitted into such a buffer
 *     (sc_layer_present_pass) - the game STAYS on its layer while a Look is applied, and the
 *     scene -> output mapping is done by the display (setGeometry) instead of a second GPU blit.
 * The compositor never alpha-blends (it composes with blits, which overwrite), so every layer is
 * marked OPAQUE and the overlay layer is cropped to the window it carries: the picture is the
 * same as the copy path's, pixel for pixel.
 *
 * Compositor thread only, except the SurfaceFlinger OnComplete callbacks (binder threads), which
 * only touch the pools under g_lock. sc_layer_hide*() is safe at any time.
