/*
 * bannerlator-wayland - the embedded compositor of the Wayland display path.
 *
 * Clients are the Wine processes of a container (winewayland.drv) and, through them,
 * Mesa's Vulkan WSI. Each process is its own client, so a Windows virtual desktop is
 * described with banner_desktop_v1: the desktop owner marks one surface as the desktop,
 * and every process reports its top-level windows' desktop positions and the Windows
 * stacking order.
 *
 * The scene is the desktop surface at the bottom, then every mapped xdg_toplevel at its
 * reported position in stacking order, each with its subsurface tree (a game's Vulkan
 * swapchain is a subsurface of its window) and wp_viewport crop/scale applied. It is
 * redrawn once per event-loop pass after any commit or layout change, stretched to the
 * Android surface.
 *
 * Input goes to the desktop surface in desktop coordinates: the Wine server routes it to
 * the window under the pointer (or the focus window) in whichever process owns it, the
 * same as winex11's virtual desktop. Without a desktop (a client that doesn't speak
 * banner_desktop_v1) the topmost window under the pointer gets it.

 * the scene blit, the effects chain, frame generation, its swapchain - is 8-bit sRGB, and a PQ-encoded
 * frame pushed through it as it stands comes out washed out. So a scene with HDR in it takes one of
 * three routes (hdr_plan):
 *   0  the HDR game ALONE on its display layer (zero-copy, or one copy) - with at most one SDR window
 *      above it on the overlay layer where this display can compose that. Best: nothing is converted.
 *   1  the HDR PICTURE: everything else without frame generation - screen effects on, a window above
 *      the game on a display that cannot take a second layer, a windowed game, zero-copy off. The whole
 *      scene is composed into ONE 10-bit PQ BT.2020 picture (SDR content placed at the SDR white; the
 *      effects run on it in 10-bit) and put on the game layer tagged BT2020_PQ (hdr_compose.h).
 *   2  frame generation: its extra frames need presents of their own, so the scene is composed into PQ
 *      and presented through an HDR10 swapchain - or, where the screen surface offers none,
 *      tone-mapped to SDR (correct colours instead of washed out).
 *   3  a frame the compositor could not import: only its display layer can show it, so effects and
 *      frame generation are skipped for it (said in the log).
 * The drawer's HDR output switch (banner_color_output) OFF: the same routes, tone-mapped - route 0
 * becomes route 1 (the whole scene composed, tone-mapped to sRGB, onto the game layer UNtagged), route 2
 * tone-maps into an SDR swapchain, route 3 cannot (nothing can read those frames) and stays HDR, said
 * in the log. The game is told nothing; it keeps rendering HDR.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ pointer constraints
 * zwp_pointer_constraints_v1 and zwp_relative_pointer_manager_v1: what winewayland uses for
 * SetCursorPos, ClipCursor and hidden-cursor (mouse-look) games.
 *
 * A lock freezes the pointer where it is: no wl_pointer.motion is sent while it holds, and
 * every input delta (a relative event from the app, or the difference between absolute
 * positions) reaches the locking program as zwp_relative_pointer_v1.relative_motion. A confine
 * clamps the pointer to the surface (and the program's region inside it). Relative motion is
 * also sent while unlocked, to any program holding a relative pointer.
 *
 * Input normally goes to the desktop surface; while a constraint holds, pointer focus moves
 * to the constrained surface, so the constraining program receives the events itself
 * (winewayland only enables relative motion for a window its pointer has entered). One
 * constraint holds at a time; a newer request ends the older one. A lock's cursor position
 * hint is applied on the surface's commit and is where the pointer ends up when the lock
 * ends (winewayland's SetCursorPos: lock, hint, commit, unlock). */
