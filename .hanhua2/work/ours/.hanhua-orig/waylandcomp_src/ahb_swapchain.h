/*
 * Zero-copy game frames (layer mode, BANNER_WAYLAND_ZERO_COPY=1 at launch, the drawer's "Zero-copy
 * presentation" switch live): the guest half of the design in ZERO_COPY_SPIKE.md. Our Wayland Turnip
 * (banners-turnip-wayland, patches/wayland/banner_ahb_wsi.py) binds the private global banner_ahb_v1
 * (version 2), which this compositor advertises on every session where a display layer is possible,
 * and follows its `mode` event: while the mode is on, each swapchain the game creates has its images
 * allocated as gralloc AHardwareBuffers, shared as dma-bufs through zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1 as before (so
 * the blit path still works) and handed to us once per wl_buffer over a socketpair
 * (banner_ahb_v1.attach). When such a buffer is the one fullscreen frame, it goes straight onto the
 * sc_layer SurfaceControl: SurfaceFlinger / the display scan out the game's own buffer, no copy
 * anywhere. A mode flip (ahb_swapchain_set_mode, from the drawer through the host queue) is
 * broadcast to every bound client; a client whose live swapchain was built for the other mode
 * retires it (VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR) so the program rebuilds it, and until then its buffers keep
 * presenting as before: an attached AHardwareBuffer stays with its wl_buffer whatever the mode is.
 *
 * Fences stay implicit, in the dma-buf itself: Mesa imports the render fence into the dma-buf
 * before it commits, we export it as the layer's acquire fence (DMA_BUF_IOCTL_EXPORT_SYNC_FILE),
 * and import SurfaceFlinger's release fence back (DMA_BUF_IOCTL_IMPORT_SYNC_FILE) before sending
 * wl_buffer.release, so Mesa's acquire (wsi_create_sync_for_dma_buf_wait) waits for the display.
 *
 * Compositor thread unless noted. Without a usable display layer (sc_layer_available() == 0) the
 * global is not created and nothing here runs.
