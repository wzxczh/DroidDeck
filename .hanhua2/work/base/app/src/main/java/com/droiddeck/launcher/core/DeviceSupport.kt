 * gets no usable Vulkan device and a session comes up as sound over a black screen - a failure
 * with nothing in it to read. The app cannot fix that, so it says so before the download rather
 * than after it. Adreno is recognised by what only Qualcomm's stack has: the KGSL node, or the
 * vendor's own Vulkan driver at its usual path.
