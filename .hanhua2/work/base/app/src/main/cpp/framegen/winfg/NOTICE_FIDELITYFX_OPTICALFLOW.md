# NOTICE - FidelityFX Optical Flow (model 3)

win-fg "model 3" (FSR3 Optical Flow) embeds compute shaders that are an
adaptation of the **AMD FidelityFX SDK FSR3 Optical Flow** algorithm.

Source passes adapted (FidelityFX-SDK, branch `main`):

- `Kits/FidelityFX/framegeneration/fsr3/include/gpu/opticalflow/ffx_opticalflow_prepare_luma.h`
  → `of3_luma.comp` (Rec.709 LDR luminance extraction)
- `Kits/FidelityFX/framegeneration/fsr3/include/gpu/opticalflow/ffx_opticalflow_compute_luminance_pyramid.h`
  → `of3_downsample.comp` (4-tap box / SPD-equivalent mip reduce)
- `Kits/FidelityFX/framegeneration/fsr3/include/gpu/opticalflow/ffx_opticalflow_compute_optical_flow_v5.h`
  → `of3_flow.comp` (SAD block-match search with coarse-level prediction)
- `Kits/FidelityFX/framegeneration/fsr3/include/gpu/opticalflow/ffx_opticalflow_scale_optical_flow_advanced_v5.h`
  → `of3_expand.comp` (bilinear upscale of coarse flow to display resolution)

The GLSL adaptations are subgroup-free / SPD-library-free re-implementations so
they compile with `glslangValidator` for Vulkan 1.1 (Adreno/Turnip-safe). They
intentionally drop the SDK's HDR transfer-function handling, wave intrinsics
(`ffxWaveSum`), `msad4`, packed-uint luma and groupshared SAD maps, none of
which are portable to bare GLSL on this stack. See per-shader DEVIATION comments.
