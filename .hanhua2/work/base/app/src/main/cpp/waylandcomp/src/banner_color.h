/*
 * HDR10 output on the Wayland backend (opt-in) - the compositor half of HDR_RECON.md Phase A (round 1)
 * plus HDR-aware composition (round 2, hdr_compose.h), implemented in wl_color_mgmt.c. The game half
 * already ships: Mesa's Wayland WSI in our Turnip is a wp_color_manager_v1 client and exposes
 * VK_COLOR_SPACE_HDR10_ST2084_EXT as soon as a compositor advertises BT.2020 + ST 2084; DXVK takes it
 * with DXVK_HDR=1 (the app exports it when the setting is on).
 *
 * THE GATE. Nothing here exists for a session unless all of these hold when the compositor starts:
 *   - the container's / game's "HDR output" setting is on, or BANNER_WAYLAND_HDR=1 in their
 *     environment (which overrides the setting either way);
 *   - the display the game is on lists HDR10 among its supported HDR types (read by the app from
 *     android.view.Display - a property of the connector, not of the device);
 *   - display layers with dataspace control (ASurfaceTransaction_setBufferDataSpace, Android 10+)
 *     and the zero-copy global (banner_ahb_v1): the HDR frame (or the composed HDR picture) is shown
 *     on the game's own display layer, tagged BT2020_PQ.
 * In game, the drawer's HDR output switch (banner_color_set_output) flips between that and the same
 * frames tone-mapped to SDR, live; the gate itself never changes during a session.
 * A closed gate advertises nothing - no colour-management global, no 10-bit dma-buf formats - so the
 * session is byte-for-byte what it was before this file existed, and the session log says why.
 * BANNER_WAYLAND_HDR=force skips the display check only (testing the negotiation on an SDR panel;
 * SurfaceFlinger then tone-maps the layer, and says so in its composition type).
 *
 * WHAT AN OPEN GATE OFFERS (exactly the subset Mesa binds, HDR_RECON.md §2.2): wp_color_manager_v1
 * version 1 with the perceptual intent, the parametric creator + mastering-display metadata,
 * BT.2020 primaries and the ST 2084 (PQ) transfer function; zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1 adds AB30/XB30
 * (A2B10G10R10, the only 10-bit layout our zero-copy WSI can put in a gralloc buffer). A surface's
 * image description is double-buffered on wl_surface.commit; its frames go onto the game's display
 * layer tagged BT2020_PQ with the game's SMPTE 2086 / CTA-861.3 metadata (sc_layer.c).
 *
 * Compositor thread unless noted.
