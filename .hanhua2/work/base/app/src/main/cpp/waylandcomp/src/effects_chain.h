/*
 * Screen-effect chain for the embedded Wayland compositor: the X11 Vulkan renderer's post
 * chain (the .frag files in app/src/main/cpp/framegen, VulkanRendererContext::recordUpscalePasses) run
 * between the composited scene and the output blit, with the same SPIR-V, push-constant
 * layouts, uniform ranges and pass order, so a saved preset looks the same on both backends.
 *
 * Present-pass hook order (vk_present.c, vkp_render):
 *     scene (all draws blitted 1:1 into a scene-sized image)
 *       -> vkp_effects_run()      this file: scaling -> effects, in the X11 order
 *       -> vkp_framegen_run()     frame generation (feat/wayland-framegen; inserted after this)
 *       -> update_map / blit      Fullscreen Mode + Screen Alignment, onto the swapchain image
 *       -> present
 * When nothing is on, vkp_effects_active() is 0 and vkp_render keeps its plain path (the draws
 * are blitted straight through the mapping; only the blit filter follows Linear/Nearest).
 *
 * Pass order (LOCKED to the X11 Vulkan renderer):
 *     scaling (SGSR / SGSR HQ / NIS / FSR EASU+RCAS / Sharpen=RCAS; None/Linear/Nearest = a
 *     filtered resize) -> FXAA -> Toon -> Colour -> CAS -> HDR -> NTSC -> CRT -> Debanding.
 * Scaling resizes the scene to its mapped output size (there is no render scale on Wayland);
 * every later pass runs at that resolution and ping-pongs between two targets.
 *
 * Settings come from any thread (JNI); the compositor thread snapshots them once per frame and
 * logs one `effects` line per change. Vulkan objects are created lazily on the first active frame.
