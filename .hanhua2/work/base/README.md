DroidDeck brings the SteamOS experience to Android: Valve's Steam client in Big Picture on your Adreno handheld, with Windows games through Valve's ARM64 Proton.

## Requirements and install

Use Android 9 or newer on a supported Adreno device (730 or newer, or 8xx). Mali, Xclipse, PowerVR, and Adreno 710 are unsupported. No root is required. Allow about 3 GB for the runtime and 1.1 GB more for the desktop and emulators. Install the APK from [Releases](https://github.com/The412Banner/DroidDeck/releases), install the Linux runtime, then press **Play** and sign in. Steam downloads on first launch. Install **Desktop & apps** to use the desktop and emulators. The **Store** installs Linux apps and games from Flathub (ARM64 builds) with Flatpak; see [docs/development/flatpak.md](docs/development/flatpak.md).

On Android 12+, if Steam exits without a log, turn off **Restrict child processes** in Developer options.

## Build

Run `tools/build_local.sh` with Docker, Java 17, the Android SDK/NDK, and `zstd` installed. It builds the ARM64 audio sinks from PulseAudio 13.0 and packages them into the APK at `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`. Set `DROIDDECK_PA13_SOURCE_DIR` to an existing PulseAudio 13.0 source directory to skip downloading it. To install the APK on an attached device, run `tools/deploy_local.sh`.

## Limits

Compatibility and performance vary by device; hardware validation is limited. Desktop compositing uses software rendering. Firefox sandboxing is reduced under proot. See the session logs in `Download/DroidDeck/` when diagnosing problems.

## Credits and licence
