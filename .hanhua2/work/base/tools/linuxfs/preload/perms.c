/*
 * Root's way past a read-only file, for the Steam client.
 *
 * The client runs as "root" inside the session - the rootfs names the app's own uid root, and
 * proot (-i) shows it that uid - but the kernel treats it as the ordinary user it is. The client
 * leaves many content files read-only (r-x------,
 * ~290 files of Proton Experimental (ARM64) alone), and when an update later rewrites one of them
 * it opens the file for writing expecting root's permission to override the mode. The kernel
 * refuses (EACCES), the client reports "Missing file permissions" and cancels the update
 * (2026-09-26: Proton Experimental (ARM64), "CFileWriter: errno: 13 ... wineopenxr.dll").
 *
 * So for the client's own processes, a refused write-open of a file this user owns is answered the
 * way root's would be: the owner's write bit is added - to the file, or to the directory a new
 * file is being created in - and the open is tried once more. chmod only succeeds on what the app
 * owns, so nothing it could not already change is touched. Games, Wine and everything else keep
 * ordinary permissions: only the processes started from the client's own directories take this.
