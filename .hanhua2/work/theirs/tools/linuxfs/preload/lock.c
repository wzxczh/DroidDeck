/*
 * Ported from WinNative (maxjivi05, feature/wayland-gamescope, 2026-09-18/19), GPL-3.0, with names
 * changed to this project's. The reasoning below is the original author's.
 *
 * File locking for the game library on external storage.
 *
 * The user's games are bound in from /storage/emulated, which Android serves over FUSE, and that
 * filesystem implements no locking at all: flock() and fcntl()'s lock commands answer ENOSYS for
 * every file under it. The Steam client takes a shared lock on each content file as it validates
 * or updates a title and treats the refusal as a failure, so a download walks its progress back
 * and forth instead of finishing; a game reading its own data hits the same wall.
 *
 * Where the kernel can lock, it does: the real call runs first and its answer stands, so files on
 * the app's own f2fs storage keep genuine cross-process exclusion. Only the filesystem that cannot
 * lock at all is answered here, and granting is the honest reading of it - a filesystem with no
 * lock state has nothing to contend over, and the one other party that could contend is inside
 * this same session. Reporting failure instead buys no safety and costs the download.
 *
 * F_GETLK is the exception: it asks who holds a lock, and on a filesystem holding none the true
 * answer is "nobody", so it is reported unlocked rather than granted.
