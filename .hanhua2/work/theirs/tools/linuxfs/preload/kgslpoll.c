/*
 * A zero-timeout KGSL timestamp wait answered as the poll it was meant to be.
 *
 * Turnip's KGSL backend emulates timeline semaphores with timestamps, and asks "has this one
 * retired yet?" by waiting on it with IOCTL_KGSL_DEVICE_WAITTIMESTAMP_CTXTID and a timeout of 0.
 * KGSL reads a timeout of 0 as no timeout at all, so the poll blocks until the GPU gets there.
 * Mesa's timeline bookkeeping polls like that under a lock on every signalling submit, which put
 * vkd3d-proton, DXVK, gamescope and Zink in lock-step with the GPU: one frame queued, never two.
 * Found and measured by Bannerlator (PROGRESS_LOG 2026-09-29: a D3D12 demo went from 614 to
 * 4335 fps with the same answer given in its Vulkan adapter); the driver-side fix is on
 * Banners-Turnip, and this covers the drivers that do not carry it yet.
 *
 * The answer comes from the context's retired timestamp, compared the way KGSL compares them
 * (with wrap-around). Anything the read does not answer - an unknown context, a device that is not
 * KGSL - goes to the kernel as before. BL_NO_KGSL_POLL_FIX=1 turns it off.
