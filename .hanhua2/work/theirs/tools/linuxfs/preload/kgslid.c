/*
 * Adreno revisions the runtime's Turnip does not know, reported as the revision it does.
 *
 * Retail SM8850 phones report their A840 as chip_id 0x44050A21 (KGSL gpu_model "Adreno840v2").
 * Mesa only lists 0x44050A31, so the runtime's glibc Turnip refuses the device outright
 * ("device (chip_id = 44050A21, gpu_id = 6860) is unsupported") and gamescope exits before Steam
 * starts. Banners-Turnip fixes its own builds by registering the v2 id on the same A840 GPU info
 * (patches/a840v2.py); answering KGSL's device-info query with the known id has the same effect
 * on any Turnip in the session, including the one the runtime was built with. A driver that
 * already knows the v2 id resolves the rewritten one to the same entry.
 *
 * Only the KGSL device-info property is touched. Its layout is the kernel's uapi (msm_kgsl.h).
