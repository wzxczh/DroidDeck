## Requirements and install

Use Android 9 or newer on a supported Adreno device (730 or newer, or 8xx). Mali, Xclipse, PowerVR, and Adreno 710 are unsupported. No root is required. Allow about 3 GB for the runtime and 1.1 GB more for the desktop and emulators. Install the APK from [Releases](https://github.com/Droid-Deck/DroidDeck/releases), install the Linux runtime, then press **Play** and sign in. Steam downloads on first launch. Install **Desktop & apps** to use the desktop and emulators. The **Store** installs Linux apps and games from Flathub (ARM64 builds) with Flatpak; with additional options to install Appimages and set up scripts.

Before Steam launches, you must turn off **Restrict child processes** in Developer options. If this option is not available in developer settings (Android 12 and 13 devices), first launch of Steam will present a "Fix it for me" button, which will help automate the setup process.

## Community

Join the [DroidDeck Discord](https://discord.gg/JRGAvawjsm) for help, Preview builds, and device reports. Bug reports go in its **#bug-reports** forum; attach the session folder from `Download/DroidDeck/` so the logs come with it.

## Build

Run `tools/build_local.sh` with Docker, Java 17, the Android SDK/NDK, and `zstd` installed. It builds the ARM64 audio sinks from PulseAudio 13.0 and packages them into the APK at `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`. Set `DROIDDECK_PA13_SOURCE_DIR` to an existing PulseAudio 13.0 source directory to skip downloading it. To install the APK on an attached device, run `tools/deploy_local.sh`.

## Limits

Compatibility and performance vary by device; hardware validation is limited. Desktop compositing uses software rendering. Firefox sandboxing is reduced under proot. See the session logs in `Download/DroidDeck/` when diagnosing problems.

## Credits and licence

GPL-3.0. Runtime, shim, input, and controller work build on WinNative and Bannerlator (maxjivi05). LSFG frame generation is from the work of Camille LaVey and the [Eden](https://eden-emu.dev) emulator project, following [lsfg-vk](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/lsfg-vk), ported to WinNative and DroidDeck by [@maxjivi05](https://github.com/maxjivi05); it needs your own copy of [Lossless Scaling](https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/) and ships none of its shaders. x86 AppImages, and any whose own runtime cannot unpack them, are unpacked with [uruntime](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/uruntime) by VHSgunzo (MIT), shipped unmodified with its licence. See [LICENSE](LICENSE). Steam and Proton belong to Valve Corporation; this project is not affiliated with Valve.
