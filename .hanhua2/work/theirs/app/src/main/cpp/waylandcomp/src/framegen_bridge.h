/*
 * Frame generation on the Wayland backend (feat/wayland-framegen).
 *
 * The two NATIVE engines the X11 renderer runs inside Bannerlator's X11 compositor - LSFG Native
 * (the user's Lossless.dll chain, lsfg/) and Win-FG Native (our own FSR3-derived optical-flow
 * chain, winfg/) - are hosted here inside the Wayland compositor's Turnip device. Both consume
 * consecutive presented frames and emit interpolated frames between them; the guest never
 * sees any of it. bionic-fg (the guest-side win-fg Vulkan layer) is X11-only and is not
 * ported: its frames are born inside the guest and have nothing to attach to here.
 *
 * Present order per scene frame (vk_present.c):
 *     scene  ->  effects  ->  FRAME GENERATION  ->  mapping/blit  ->  swapchain
 * The scene is composed 1:1 into an off-screen image, the effects chain runs on it, then
 * vkp_framegen_run() (the one hook) feeds that image to the engine and hands back up to three
 * generated images. vk_present.c blits the generated frames to the screen FIRST and the real
 * frame LAST (interpolation produces frames that belong between N-1 and N), one FIFO present
 * each, so the panel shows them on consecutive vblanks - the same pacing the X11 native path
 * is device-proven with. No sleeps, no host-side pacer.
 *
 * Threads: the set_* controls are called from the app (JNI, any thread) and only store
 * values; everything that touches Vulkan runs on the compositor thread inside vkp_render().
