// lsfg_governor - decides whether an extra generated frame is actually WORTH
// it on this device, right now.
//
// The ported pacer answers "how many frames fit in the panel's budget". That
// is necessary but not sufficient on a handheld: the LSFG chain competes with
// the game for the same GPU, so a naive fixed 3x on a GPU-bound title lowers
// the real frame rate by more than the generated frames add. The user sees a
// higher HUD number and a worse-looking game.
//
// So the multiplier is treated as a ceiling to earn, not a setting to obey.
// The governor starts at 0 generations, periodically PROBES one more, and
// keeps it only if the probe measurably paid off:
//
//   * total output rate must improve by at least 1.15x, and
//   * the real (source) frame rate must not collapse below 0.70x baseline.
//
// A failed probe reverts immediately and backs off 5s, 15s, 30s, then 60s, so
// a device that cannot afford another generation stops being asked.
//
// Thermals are the second input a phone needs and a desktop does not.
// Sustained frame generation is a thermal decision as much as a performance
// one, so the governor gives back generations as the device heats and refuses
// to probe while it is throttling.
