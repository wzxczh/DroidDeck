/**
 * `app.log`: what the app itself said while the session ran, and `crash.log`: what Android's crash
 * buffer holds if something died hard.
 *
 * Everything this app decides is reported through `Log` - which driver was chosen and why, the
 * audio line, a rival client being stopped, the session's exit status, a helper that was missing.
 * None of it reaches a user's folder, so a report used to arrive with the settings visible in
 * `device.txt` and no record of what actually happened. An app may always read back its own log
 * entries, so the simplest complete answer is to run `logcat` filtered to our own pid and keep
 * what it says.
 *
 * `logcat -b crash` earns its own file: proot once died before `main` over a missing library, and
 * that appeared in the crash buffer and *nowhere else* - not in the session log, not in the main
 * buffer. It is the first thing to read when a session "exits instantly".
 *
 * Both are best-effort. Where a ROM refuses to hand an app its own entries the files are written
 * with a line saying so, which is better than their absence looking like silence.
