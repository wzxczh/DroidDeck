/**
 * One folder per session under `Download/DroidDeck/`, holding everything that session recorded,
 * named for the day, that day's session number and what was run, so the one a report is about can
 * be picked out without opening any:
 *
 * ```
 *   Download/DroidDeck/2026-09-30-03-steam/
 *       device.txt     what this device is, and every setting the session ran with
 *       session.log    the guest session: proot, gamescope, the client's stdout
 *       wayland.log    the app's compositor
 *       steam.log      the Steam client's own log, scrubbed  (Steam mode)
 *       steam/         the rest of the client's logs, scrubbed  (Steam mode)
 *       desktop.log    labwc, the panel and the programs on it  (desktop mode)
 *   Download/DroidDeck/tools/  one-off commands: Flatpak installs, AppImage imports
 * ```
 *
 * Folders from before this naming (`session-20260930-180642`) are still recognised, shared and
 * pruned with the rest.
 *
 * The folder is claimed by whoever starts first - the activity starts the compositor before the
 * service starts the session - so both write into the same one, and a recreated activity (a
 * foldable opening mid-session) joins the folder in progress instead of opening another.
